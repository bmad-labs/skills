## Praise for *The Clean Coder*

> "Uncle Bob" Martin definitely raises the bar with his latest book. He explains his expectation for a professional programmer on management interactions, time management, pressure, on collaboration, and on the choice of tools to use. Beyond TDD and ATDD, Martin explains what every programmer who considers him- or herself a professional not only needs to know, but also needs to follow in order to make the young profession of software development grow."

> "Some technical books inspire and teach; some delight and amuse. Rarely does a technical book do all four of these things. Robert Martin's always have for me and *The Clean Coder* is no exception. Read, learn, and live the lessons in this book and you can accurately call yourself a software professional."
>
> --- *George Bullock, Senior Program Manager, Microsoft Corp.*

> "If a computer science degree had 'required reading for after you graduate,' this would be it. In the real world, your bad code doesn't vanish when the semester's over, you don't get an A for marathon coding the night before an assignment's due, and, worst of all, you have to deal with people. So, coding gurus are not necessarily professionals. *The Clean Coder* describes the journey to professionalism . . . and it does a remarkably entertaining job of it."
>
> --- *Jeff Overbey, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign*

> "*The Clean Coder* is much more than a set of rules or guidelines. It contains hard-earned wisdom and knowledge that is normally obtained through many years of trial and error or by working as an apprentice to a master craftsman. If you call yourself a software professional, you need this book."
>

> Between 1986 and 2000 I worked closely with Jim Newkirk, a colleague from Teradyne. He and I shared a passion for programming and for clean code. We would spend nights, evenings, and weekends together playing with different programming styles and design techniques. We were continually scheming about business ideas. Eventually we formed Object Mentor, Inc., together. I learned many things from Jim as we plied our schemes together. But one of the most important was his attitude of *work ethic;* it was something I strove to emulate. Jim is a professional. I am proud to have worked with him, and to call him my friend.
