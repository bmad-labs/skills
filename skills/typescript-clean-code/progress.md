## Workflows

- [x] workflows/code-review/workflow.md - Review code for quality (step-file architecture: 10 step files)
- [x] workflows/pr-review/workflow.md - Review pull requests (step-file architecture: 10 step files)
- [x] workflows/tdd.md - Test-driven development cycle
- [x] workflows/refactoring/workflow.md - Safe refactoring with tests (step-file architecture: 8 step files)

### Step-File Workflows (new)

Code review, PR review, and refactoring workflows converted to step-file architecture for context-safe execution. Original files preserved as `.legacy.md`.

- [x] workflows/code-review.legacy.md (original, preserved for reference)
- [x] workflows/pr-review.legacy.md (original, preserved for reference)
- [x] workflows/refactoring.legacy.md (original, preserved for reference)
