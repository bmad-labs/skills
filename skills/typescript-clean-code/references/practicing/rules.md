# Practicing Rules

Rules for effective deliberate practice as a professional developer.

## Core Rules

### 1. Practice on Your Own Time

Professional programmers practice on their own time. It is not your employer's job to keep your skills sharp.

- Patients don't pay doctors to practice sutures
- Concert-goers don't pay to hear musicians play scales
- Employers don't pay you for practice time
- Your skills are your responsibility

### 2. Use Different Languages and Platforms

Since practice time is your own, you don't have to use the same technologies as your employer.

- Pick any language you like
- Keep your polyglot skills sharp
- If you work in .NET, practice Java or Ruby at lunch
- Broadens your resume and mindset

### 3. Know Multiple Kata

A programmer should know several different kata and practice them regularly.

- Practice so they don't fade from memory
- Each kata teaches different problem/solution pairs
- Mix up your practice routine
- Aim for variety in types of problems

### 4. Practice Until Automatic

The goal is to make movements automatic and instinctive.

- Repeat exercises until you know them cold
- Your body should know what keys to hit
- Mind free for higher-level strategy
- Pattern recognition becomes instant

### 5. Contribute to Open Source

Take on pro-bono work to broaden your experience.

- Work on something someone else cares about
- Best way to increase your repertoire
- If you write Java, contribute to a Rails project
- Prevents unhealthy narrowing of skills

## Guidelines

Less strict recommendations:

- Start with simple kata before complex ones
- Record your practice to review technique
- Set kata to music for an advanced challenge
- Join or form a local coding dojo
- Practice the same kata in different languages

## When to Practice

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| Lunch break | Quick kata (15-20 min) |
| Before work | Morning warm-up kata |
| Evening | Longer practice sessions |
| Weekends | Open source contributions |

## Exceptions

When these rules may be relaxed:

- **Learning new tech at work**: If employer is paying for training, that's different from practice
- **Pair programming**: Work-time pairing has some practice benefits, but isn't deliberate practice
- **Hackathons**: May be employer-sponsored but still provide practice value

## Practice Ethics Summary

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Practice on your own time | Expect employer to pay for skill sharpening |
| Use different languages | Limit yourself to work technologies |
| Contribute to open source | Only work on paid projects |
| Practice regularly | Let skills fade from lack of use |
| Take responsibility for your skills | Blame employer for skill gaps |

## Quick Reference

| Rule | Summary |
|------|---------|
| Own time | Practice is your responsibility, not employer's |
| Polyglot | Practice different languages than work |
| Multiple kata | Know several, practice regularly |
| Automatic | Repeat until movements are instinctive |
| Open source | Contribute to broaden experience |
