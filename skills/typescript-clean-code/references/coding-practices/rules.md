# Coding Practices Rules

Rules for professional behavior, mindset, and practices while coding.

## Core Rules

### 1. Never Code When Impaired

**Don't write code when you are tired, worried, or distracted.**

- Tired coding produces bugs, wrong structure, and opaque solutions
- Code written at 3 AM will haunt you for years
- Worry creates a background process that consumes focus
- Any code produced while impaired will need rework

**Action**: Find a way to eliminate distractions and settle your mind first.

### 2. Avoid the Flow Zone

**Deliberately exit the Zone when you feel yourself slipping into it.**

- Walk away for a few minutes
- Answer emails, check messages
- Take a lunch break
- Find a pair partner (pairing blocks Zone entry)

**Why**: Zone code comes out faster but needs more revisiting.

### 3. Handle Interruptions Gracefully

**Respond to interruptions with polite willingness to help.**

- Don't snap or glare at people asking questions
- Treat others as you'd want to be treated when stuck
- Use pair programming to maintain context during interruptions
- Use TDD - failing tests hold your context

**Remember**: Next time you may need to interrupt someone else.

### 4. Seek Creative Input

**Feed your creativity to prevent blockages.**

- Read broadly (software, science, fiction, varied topics)
- Find what works for you (novels, movies, music)
- Escapism combined with creative stimulation fuels output
- Creativity breeds creativity

### 5. Minimize Debugging Time

**Treat debugging time as expensive coding time to be reduced.**

- Adopt TDD or equivalent discipline
- Aim for zero debugging time (asymptotic goal)
- Creating many bugs is unprofessional
- Track and measure debugging time

### 6. Know When to Walk Away

**Disengage when stuck or tired.**

- Can't solve a problem? Go home anyway
- Pounding a nonfunctioning brain wastes time
- Give your creative subconscious a chance
- Solutions come in showers, cars, and off-hours

### 7. Never Incorporate Hope Into Estimates

**Be honest about schedule reality.**

- Provide three estimates: best case, nominal, worst case
- Update estimates daily with fact-based data
- Hope destroys schedules and ruins reputations
- Make sure everyone understands the situation

### 8. Don't Rush

**Hold to your original estimates under pressure.**

- You cannot make yourself code faster
- Rushing creates messes that slow everyone
- Shortcuts and extra hours provide false hope
- Reduce scope instead of promising miracles

### 9. Agree to Overtime Only Conditionally

**Accept overtime only when all three conditions are met:**

1. You can personally afford it
2. It is short term (two weeks or less)
3. Your boss has a fall-back plan if overtime fails

**Note**: 20% more hours does not yield 20% more work.

### 10. Never Falsely Deliver

**Don't say you're done when you aren't.**

- Overt lies are bad; rationalized definitions of "done" are worse
- False delivery is contagious on teams
- Create independent definition of "done" with automated acceptance tests
- "Checked-in" does not mean "done"

### 11. Help Others and Accept Help

**Make yourself available; accept help graciously.**

- Sequestering yourself is a violation of professional ethics
- Set specific available hours if you need alone time
- When stuck, ask for help - remaining stuck is unprofessional
- Give help sessions at least 30 minutes; accept help for 30 minutes before excusing yourself

### 12. Partition Worry Time

**Deal with personal worries deliberately, not during coding.**

- Dedicate a block of time to the worry (perhaps an hour)
- Call home, address financial issues, talk through arguments
- Reduce anxiety to quiet the background process
- Ideally handle on personal time; if at office, better than forcing bad code

## Guidelines

Less strict recommendations:

- Be suspicious of music while coding - it may just help you enter the Zone
- Use pair programming as first resort for writer's block
- Learn your patterns of creativity and brilliance
- Recognize that the drive home and shower are problem-solving time
- Mentor junior developers; seek mentoring from seniors

## Exceptions

When these rules may be relaxed:

- **Zone for practice**: The Zone is fine during deliberate practice sessions (katas, exercises)
- **Short overtime**: Acceptable for genuine short-term crunches with fall-back plans
- **Urgent production issues**: May need to code tired, but expect to revisit the code

## Quick Reference

| Rule | Summary |
|------|---------|
| 3 AM Code | Never code when tired - produces lasting problems |
| Worry Code | Resolve worries first or partition time for them |
| Flow Zone | Avoid it - walk away when you feel it coming |
| Interruptions | Be politely helpful; rudeness is unprofessional |
| Walking Away | Do it when stuck; subconscious will work |
| Hope | Never include in estimates; it kills projects |
| Rushing | Impossible; reduces scope instead |
| Overtime | Only if affordable, short, and has fall-back |
| False Delivery | Never; define "done" with automated tests |
| Helping | Honor bound to offer and accept help |
