# Saying No Examples

Dialogue examples demonstrating professional ways to decline requests.

## Bad Examples

### Avoiding Confrontation (Both Parties Fail)

> Paula: "Mike, I need the login page done by tomorrow."
>
> Mike: "Oh, wow! That soon? Well, OK, I'll try."
>
> Paula: "OK, that's great. Thanks!"

**Problems**:
- Paula is lying - she knows it takes longer than a day
- Mike accepts "I'll try" as "Yes" - a dumb mistake
- Both avoid confrontation but create future disaster
- Neither party searched for the best possible outcome

### Passive Acceptance (No Advocacy)

> Paula: "Mike, I need the login page done by tomorrow."
>
> Mike: "Oh, sorry Mike, but it's going to take me more time than that."
>
> Paula: "When do you think you can have it done?"
>
> Mike: "How about two weeks from now?"
>
> Paula: (scribbles in daytimer) "OK, thanks."

**Problems**:
- Paula should state her timeline assertively, not ask permission
- Mike accepts without question, as if his objectives don't matter
- Likely to lead to passive-aggressive blame later
- Neither defended their position

### Manager Commits Team Without Input

> Don: "OK Mike, the customer is coming in six weeks. They're expecting to see everything working."
>
> Mike: "Yes, and we'll be ready. My team is busting their butts and we're going to get it done. We'll have to work some overtime, but we'll make it happen!"
>
> Don: "It's great that you and your staff are such team players."

**Problems**:
- Mike committed Paula's team to something she explicitly said was impossible
- Mike is playing for himself, not the team
- "Team player" label rewards dishonesty
- Disaster is now scheduled

## Good Examples

### Professional Negotiation

> Mike: "Paula, I need the login page done by tomorrow."
>
> Paula: "No, Mike, that's a two-week job."
>
> Mike: "Two weeks? The architects estimated it at three days!"
>
> Paula: "The architects were wrong. I've got at least ten more days of work. Didn't you see my updated estimate on the wiki?"
>
> Mike: "This isn't acceptable Paula. Customers are coming tomorrow, and I need the login page working."
>
> Paula: "What part of the login page do you need working by tomorrow?"
>
> Mike: "I need to be able to log in."
>
> Paula: "I can give you a mock-up that lets you log in. It won't check passwords, email forgotten passwords, or have the news banner. But you'll be able to log in. Will that do?"
>
> Mike: "I'll be able to log in?"
>
> Paula: "Yes."
>
> Mike: "That's great Paula, you're a life saver!"

**Why it works**:
- Paula says no clearly and firmly
- She offers what IS possible as an alternative
- They negotiate to find the best possible outcome
- Both parties get something valuable

### Refusing to "Try"

> Mike: "Come on Paula, can't you guys at least try?"
>
> Paula: "Mike, I could try to levitate. I could try to change lead into gold. I could try to swim across the Atlantic. Do you think I'd succeed?"
>
> Mike: "Now you're being unreasonable. I'm not asking for the impossible."
>
> Paula: "Yes, Mike, you are."

**Why it works**:
- Paula refuses the "try" trap clearly
- Uses absurdity to show the request is impossible
- Doesn't leave any room for false hope
- Maintains her position despite pressure

### Threatening Escalation Professionally

> Paula: "Mike, have you told Don about my estimates?"
>
> Mike: "Yeah, but you were going to try anyway, right?"
>
> Paula: "We've already had that discussion. Remember, gold and lead?"
>
> Mike: "You've just got to do it. Please do whatever it takes."
>
> Paula: "Mike. I don't have to make this happen for you. What I have to do, if you don't, is tell Don."
>
> Mike: "That'd be going over my head."
>
> Paula: "I don't want to, but I will if you force me."

**Why it works**:
- Paula gives Mike the chance to act first
- Clear deadline: "tomorrow I expect a meeting"
- Documents in writing (memo)
- Explains she's protecting both of them

### High Stakes Confrontation

> Charles: "Damn it Don! This was supposed to be done three weeks ago! You've got to do better."
>
> Don: "Chuck, I told you three months ago, after the layoffs, that we'd need four more months. You cut my staff twenty percent!"
>
> Charles: "Without Galitron, we're really hosed. Don, you've got to do better."
>
> Don: "There's nothing I can do Chuck. Galitron won't cut scope, won't accept interim releases. I cannot do that any faster. It's not going to happen."
>
> Charles: "I don't suppose it would matter if I told you your job was at stake."
>
> Don: "Firing me isn't going to change the estimate, Charles."

**Why it works**:
- Don stands firm under extreme pressure
- Provides facts, not excuses
- Doesn't cave even when job is threatened
- CEO can now make informed decisions

## Contrast: Same Situation, Different Approaches

### The Wrong Response to Pressure

> Bill and Jalil: "No, it's really got to be Friday. Can you at least try?"
>
> Team Lead: "OK, we'll try."

**Result**: Blazing disaster. System crashed repeatedly. Customer told them to shut it down. Everyone quit.

### The Right Response to Pressure

> Bill and Jalil: "It's got to be ready by Friday."
>
> Professional Response: "Look, we just barely got this system to sort-of work. We need to shake down the troubles. We need four weeks. Friday is not possible."

**Note**: The team lead should have maintained this position. Professionals speak truth to power and have the courage to say no to their managers.

## Key Patterns

| Situation | Bad Response | Good Response |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| Impossible deadline | "I'll try" | "No, that's a two-week job" |
| Pressure to commit | Accept silently | "What part do you actually need?" |
| Repeated manipulation | Eventually cave | "We've had this discussion" |
| Boss ignores warnings | Passive aggression | "I will escalate tomorrow" |
| Threatened with firing | Cave to pressure | "Firing me won't change the estimate" |
