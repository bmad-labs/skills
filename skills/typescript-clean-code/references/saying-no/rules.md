# Saying No Rules

Guidelines for when and how to decline requests professionally.

## Core Rules

### 1. Say No to Impossible Commitments

If you know something cannot be done by the requested deadline, say no clearly.

- Don't agree hoping things will work out
- Don't cave to pressure or intimidation
- State the fact plainly: "No, that's a two-week job"

### 2. Never Promise to "Try"

The promise to try implies you were holding back effort before.

- "Trying" is a commitment to succeed with extra effort
- If you have no new plan, promising to try is dishonest
- Either you can do it or you can't - "trying" is a lie

### 3. Avoid Passive Aggression

Don't let others walk off a cliff just to prove you were right.

- Escalate when someone won't communicate bad news
- Warn teammates of impending disasters
- Cover-your-ass memos are not enough - take action

### 4. Defend Your Estimates Under Pressure

Maintain your position through wheedling, cajoling, and manipulation.

- Keep stating the uncertainty: "eight or nine weeks"
- Don't suggest extra effort could change the outcome
- Document your estimates in writing (memos, email)

### 5. Negotiate Toward the Best Outcome

Say no, then work together to find what IS possible.

- Ask what parts are actually needed
- Offer alternatives with reduced scope
- Find the mutually acceptable solution

## Guidelines

Less strict recommendations:

- Explain the "why" only if it helps - facts matter more than reasons
- Too much detail invites micro-management
- When escalating, give the person a chance to act first
- Set deadlines for action before going over someone's head

## When to Escalate

Circumstances requiring you to go above someone's head:

- **Ignored warnings**: They won't tell their boss about real problems
- **Approaching disaster**: Customers will arrive expecting impossible deliverables
- **Continued manipulation**: Repeated attempts to get you to "try"

Always give warning first: "If that meeting doesn't happen tomorrow, I will be forced to go to Don myself."

## Exceptions

When these rules may be relaxed:

- **Genuine new information**: If scope actually shrinks, revise estimates
- **Real options emerge**: New resources or timeline extensions change facts
- **Collaborative problem-solving**: Brainstorming alternatives is not caving

## What NOT to Do

Behaviors to avoid:

- Don't say "OK, I'll try" to avoid confrontation
- Don't accept dates without defending your objectives
- Don't let others commit you to impossible deadlines
- Don't sacrifice quality practices to meet unrealistic dates
- Don't work 80-hour weeks hoping to be a hero
- Don't stay silent when you see a disaster coming
