# Commitment Knowledge

Core concepts and foundational understanding for making real commitments.

## Overview

Commitment is a three-part process: saying, meaning, and doing. Most communication failures stem from unclear commitment language. Professionals use specific language patterns that signal genuine commitment versus vague promises.

## Key Concepts

### The Say/Mean/Do Framework

**Definition**: A commitment requires three sequential parts that must all be present.

1. You **say** you'll do it
2. You **mean** it
3. You **actually do** it

**Key points**:
- Most people fail at one or more stages
- Saying without meaning creates false expectations
- Meaning without doing breaks trust

### Language of Commitment

**Definition**: Specific verbal patterns that indicate genuine commitment versus hedging.

The formula for real commitment: **"I will... by..."**

**Key points**:
- States a fact about what YOU will do
- Includes a clear end time
- Creates binary outcome (done or not done)
- Takes full personal responsibility

### Victim vs. Owner Mindset

**Definition**: The distinction between treating situations as outside your control versus taking ownership.

Non-commitment phrases assume things are out of "my" hands. Real commitment acknowledges you ALWAYS have something under your control.

## Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Weasel words | Language that sounds like commitment but avoids it |
| Red flag | Early warning that a commitment may not be met |
| Binary response | A clear yes or no answer, not fuzzy language |
| Commitment language | "I will X by Y" - specific, time-bound promise |
| Stakeholder | Anyone relying on your commitment |

## The "Try" Problem

There are two meanings of "try":
1. **Extra effort** - Working harder to achieve something
2. **Maybe, maybe not** - Hedging without real commitment

When someone says "I'll try," they often mean the second definition while implying the first.

## Why Commitment Matters

- **Estimations**: Clear commitments improve planning accuracy
- **Deadlines**: Binary language eliminates ambiguity
- **Trust**: Following through builds professional reputation
- **Collaboration**: Others can depend on your promises

## Common Misconceptions

- **Myth**: You can only commit to final outcomes
  **Reality**: You can commit to specific actions that move toward a goal

- **Myth**: Commitment means never failing
  **Reality**: Commitment means raising red flags early when problems arise

- **Myth**: Professionals always say yes
  **Reality**: Professionals say no when they can't genuinely commit
