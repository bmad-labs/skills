# Commitment Examples

Dialogue examples demonstrating commitment vs non-commitment language.

## Non-Commitment Language

### Weasel Words to Avoid

| Word/Phrase | Example | Problem |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| Need/Should | "We need to get this done." | No personal ownership |
| Hope/Wish | "I hope to get this done by tomorrow." | No commitment to outcome |
| Let's | "Let's meet sometime." | Vague, no specific action |
| Try | "I'll try to get that done as well." | Maybe/maybe not hedge |

### Bad Response Examples

**IT guy avoiding responsibility**:
> "Yeah. We really need to get some new routers."

**Problem**: Uses "need" - nothing will happen.

**Developer hedging on testing**:
> "Sure. I hope to get to it by the end of the day."

**Problem**: Uses "hope" - no real commitment made.

**Manager deflecting**:
> "We have to move faster."

**Problem**: Uses "we" and "have to" - really means YOU should do something.

### The "Doable" Trap

> Marge: "Peter, will you have the rating engine mods done by Friday?"
>
> Peter: "I think that's doable."
>
> Marge: "Will that include the documentation?"
>
> Peter: "I'll try to get that done as well."

**Problems**:
- "I think that's doable" is not yes or no
- "I'll try" is the maybe/maybe not hedge
- Marge asked boolean questions, got fuzzy answers

## Commitment Language

### The Formula

**Pattern**: "I will [specific action] by [specific time]."

**Good examples**:
- "I will finish this by Tuesday."
- "I will have the docs ready by Monday morning."
- "I will call you by 3pm today with an update."

### Honest Uncertainty

Better than hedging - express uncertainty explicitly:

> Marge: "Peter, will you have the rating engine mods done by Friday?"
>
> Peter: "Probably, but it might be Monday."
>
> Marge: "Will that include the documentation?"
>
> Peter: "The documentation will take me another few hours, so Monday is possible, but it might be as late as Tuesday."

**Why it works**:
- Describes his actual uncertainty
- Gives Marge real information to work with
- No false promises

### Saying No Professionally

When you can't commit, say so clearly:

> Marge: "Peter, I need a definite yes or no. Will you have the rating engine finished and documented by Friday?"
>
> Peter: "In that case, Marge, I'll have to say no. The soonest I can be sure that I'll be done with the mods and the docs is Tuesday."
>
> Marge: "You are committing to Tuesday?"
>
> Peter: "Yes, I will have it all ready on Tuesday."

**Why it works**:
- Clear no to the impossible date
- Offers alternative he CAN commit to
- Final statement is real commitment language

### Negotiating a Real Commitment

When there's pressure but a path forward:

> Marge: "Peter, look, I know this is a huge imposition, but I really need you to find a way to get this all done by Monday morning."
>
> Peter: "OK, Marge, I'll tell you what. I'll call home and clear some overtime with my family. If they are OK with it, then I'll get this task done by Monday morning. I'll even come in on Monday morning to make sure everything goes smoothly with Willy. But then I'll go home and won't be back until Wednesday. Deal?"

**Why it works**:
- Acknowledges real constraints (family, recovery time)
- Makes explicit trade-off visible
- Conditional commitment with clear terms
- Real "I will" language with specific time

### Breaking Dependencies into Controllable Actions

**Instead of**: "I will finish the module with full integration."

**Commit to**:
- "I will sit down for an hour with Gary to understand dependencies."
- "I will create an interface that abstracts my module's dependency."
- "I will meet three times this week with the build guy."
- "I will create my own personal build that runs integration tests."

**Instead of**: "I will fix all 25 bugs before release."

**Commit to**:
- "I will go through all 25 bugs and try to recreate them."
- "I will sit down with the QA who found each bug to see a repro."
- "I will spend all my time this week trying to fix each bug."

## Summary Comparison

| Non-Commitment | Commitment |

| "We need to..." | "I will..." |
| "I hope to..." | "I will... by..." |
| "I'll try to..." | "Yes, I will" or "No, I cannot" |
| "That's doable" | "Yes" or "Probably, but might be [date]" |
| "Let's meet sometime" | "I will meet you at [place] at [time]" |
