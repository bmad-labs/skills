# Commitment Rules

Rules for making and keeping professional commitments.

## Core Rules

### 1. Use "I will... by..." Language

State what YOU will do with a clear end time.

- First person singular ("I"), not "we" or "someone"
- Specific action, not vague intention
- Concrete deadline, not "soon" or "when I can"

**Example**:
```
// Bad
"We need to get this done."
"I'll try to finish it."
"Hopefully by next week."

// Good
"I will finish the API integration by Thursday 5pm."
```

### 2. Only Commit to What You Control

You can only commit to things fully under your control.

- If outcome depends on others, commit to YOUR actions
- Break external dependencies into controllable steps
- Commit to actions that move you toward the goal

**Example**:
```
// Bad - depends on others
"I will finish the module with full integration with the other team."

// Good - actions you control
"I will meet with Gary from infrastructure for one hour tomorrow."
"I will create an interface that abstracts the dependency."
"I will create a personal build that runs integration tests."
```

### 3. Raise Red Flags Immediately

When a commitment is at risk, notify stakeholders as soon as possible.

- Don't wait until the deadline passes
- Earlier notice = more options for the team
- Enables replanning, reprioritizing, or getting help

### 4. Give Binary Responses

Answer yes/no questions with yes or no.

- Avoid fuzzy responses to boolean questions
- Express uncertainty explicitly with ranges
- "Probably, but it might be Monday" is better than "I think that's doable"

### 5. Maintain Discipline Under Pressure

Never sacrifice professional standards to meet a commitment.

- Don't skip tests to go faster (you won't)
- Don't skip refactoring (it slows you down)
- Don't skip regression suites
- Your commitment to standards comes first

## Guidelines

- Know your limits for overtime and its costs
- Clear overtime with family/stakeholders before committing to it
- Plan for recovery time after intense effort
- Be honest with yourself about stamina and reserves

## Exceptions

- **Discovery work**: When you genuinely don't know if something is possible, commit to actions that will find out
- **External blockers**: When dependencies are truly outside your control, commit to escalation and communication actions

## When NOT to Commit

Situations where you should say no:

- You don't have full control over the outcome
- Meeting the deadline would require breaking professional standards
- You're being asked to commit to "try" harder (vague effort)
- The timeline doesn't account for realistic uncertainty
