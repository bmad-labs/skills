# Pressure Rules

Rules for avoiding and handling pressure as a professional developer.

## Core Rules

### 1. Never Change Your Behavior in a Crisis

Your disciplines exist to guide you through high-pressure times. If you abandon them under pressure, you don't truly believe in them.

- If you follow TDD normally but abandon it in crisis, you don't trust TDD
- If you keep code clean normally but make messes in crisis, you don't believe messes slow you down
- Choose disciplines you're comfortable following in a crisis, then follow them all the time

### 2. Never Commit to Deadlines You Can't Meet

The business wants commitments to eliminate risk. Your job is to quantify and present risk so they can manage it.

- Make sure risk is visible to the business
- Accepting unrealistic commitments does a disservice to everyone
- When commitments are made for you, help find a way to meet them but don't accept responsibility for promises you didn't make

### 3. Stay Clean to Go Fast

"Quick and dirty" is an oxymoron. Dirty always means slow.

- Don't tolerate messes - they cause missed dates
- Don't spend endless hours polishing, but don't create messes either
- Keep systems, code, and design as clean as possible

### 4. Don't Panic When Pressure Hits

Rushing drives you deeper into the hole. Manage your stress instead.

- Sleepless nights won't help you get done faster
- Sitting and fretting won't help either
- Slow down and think the problem through
- Plot a course to the best outcome and drive toward it at steady pace

### 5. Communicate Early and Often

Nothing makes people more angry and less rational than surprises.

- Let team and superiors know when you're in trouble
- Tell them your best plans for getting out of trouble
- Ask for input and guidance
- Surprises multiply pressure by ten

### 6. Rely More on Disciplines Under Pressure

These are the times to pay special attention to all your disciplines, not question or abandon them.

- Write even more tests than usual if you follow TDD
- Refactor even more if you're a merciless refactorer
- Keep functions even smaller if you normally keep them small
- Become more deliberate and dedicated to your disciplines

### 7. Get Help Through Pairing

When the heat is on, pair programming helps you get done faster with fewer defects.

- Your partner helps you hold onto disciplines and keeps you from panicking
- Your partner spots things you miss and has helpful ideas
- Your partner picks up slack when you lose focus
- Offer to pair with others when you see them under pressure

## Guidelines

- Be calm and decisive under pressure - this defines professional behavior
- Know that your disciplines are the best way to meet deadlines and commitments
- Help the business find ways to meet its goals while maintaining professional standards
- When you can't meet promises made by others, those who made the promises must accept responsibility

## Exceptions

- **External commitments made without you**: You should help find solutions but are not honor bound to accept commitments made for you by the business
