# Pressure Knowledge

Core concepts and foundational understanding for handling pressure professionally.

## Overview

Pressure is inevitable in software development - deadlines, missed estimates, and crises occur. What separates professionals from amateurs is how they behave under that pressure. The key insight is "crisis discipline": your true beliefs are revealed by how you behave in a crisis, not in calm times.

## Key Concepts

### Crisis Discipline

**Definition**: The principle that you should behave in a crisis the same way you wish you always behaved - following your established disciplines rather than abandoning them.

Your behavior in a crisis reveals your true beliefs about your practices. If you abandon TDD under pressure, you don't truly trust TDD. If you make messes when rushed, you don't truly believe that messes slow you down.

**Key points**:
- Choose disciplines you feel comfortable following in a crisis
- Then follow them all the time
- Following disciplines prevents crises from occurring
- Don't change behavior when the crunch comes

### Avoiding Pressure

**Definition**: Proactive strategies to minimize and shorten high-pressure periods before they occur.

The best way to stay calm under pressure is to avoid situations that cause it. Prevention is more effective than reaction.

**Key points**:
- Avoid committing to deadlines you aren't sure you can meet
- Keep systems, code, and design clean at all times
- "Quick and dirty" is an oxymoron - dirty always means slow
- Messes slow you down and cause missed dates

### Handling Pressure

**Definition**: Reactive strategies for when pressure occurs despite your best prevention efforts.

Sometimes projects take longer than expected, designs need rework, or commitments can't be kept. When this happens, professionals have specific responses.

**Key points**:
- Don't panic - rushing drives you deeper into the hole
- Communicate with team and superiors
- Rely on your disciplines more, not less
- Get help through pairing

## Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Crisis Discipline | Following your normal disciplines during high-pressure times |
| Staying Clean | Not creating messes to move faster |
| Forestalling Pressure | Preventing pressure through good practices |
| Weathering Pressure | Managing pressure when it can't be avoided |

## How It Relates To

- **Commitment**: Managing commitments prevents unrealistic deadlines that cause pressure
- **Estimation**: Proper estimation with risk quantification avoids pressure situations
- **TDD**: A key discipline to maintain (not abandon) under pressure
- **Professionalism**: Calm, decisive behavior under pressure defines a professional

## Common Misconceptions

- **Myth**: Working more hours under pressure shows dedication
  **Reality**: Sleepless nights and rushing won't help - they drive you deeper into trouble

- **Myth**: Quick and dirty code helps meet deadlines
  **Reality**: Dirty always means slow - messes slow you down and cause missed dates

- **Myth**: Abandoning practices like TDD saves time during crunch
  **Reality**: If you abandon disciplines under pressure, you don't truly believe in them

- **Myth**: Pressure requires changing how you work
  **Reality**: Your disciplines are the best way through - follow them even more carefully
