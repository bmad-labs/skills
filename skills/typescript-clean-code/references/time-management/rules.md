# Time Management Rules

Specific guidelines for managing time, meetings, and focus as a professional developer.

## Core Rules

### 1. Decline Meetings Without Clear Value

You do not have to attend every meeting. Going to too many meetings is unprofessional.

- Only accept if participation is immediately and significantly necessary to YOUR job
- The inviter is not responsible for managing your time - only you can do that
- Interest alone is not sufficient reason to attend
- Your responsibility is to your projects first

**Ask before accepting**:
- What discussions are on the table?
- How much time is allotted for each topic?
- What goal is to be achieved?
- If no clear answers, politely decline

### 2. Leave Meetings That Waste Your Time

When the meeting gets boring, leave.

- Remaining in a wasteful meeting is unprofessional
- You have an obligation to wisely spend your employer's time and money
- Don't storm out - negotiate exit at an appropriate moment
- Ask: "Is my presence still necessary?" or "Can we expedite the discussion?"

### 3. Require Agendas and Goals

Meetings must have clear structure to justify their cost.

- Clear agenda with times for each topic
- Stated goal to achieve
- If agenda is hijacked, request return to original topics
- If agenda cannot be restored, leave when possible

### 4. Keep Stand-ups Under 10 Minutes

Three questions only, 20 seconds each maximum:

1. What did I do yesterday?
2. What am I going to do today?
3. What's in my way?

- Each person: ~1 minute maximum
- 10 people: under 10 minutes total
- Stand to discourage lingering

### 5. Limit Iteration Planning to 5% of Iteration Time

One-week iteration = 2 hours maximum for planning.

- Estimates should already be done for candidates
- Business value assessment should already be done
- 5-10 minutes maximum per backlog item
- Longer discussions scheduled separately with subset of team

### 6. Schedule Retrospectives Before Quitting Time

Schedule 45 minutes before end of last day of iteration.

- 20 minutes for retrospective
- 25 minutes for demo
- Only a week or two of work - shouldn't need more time

### 7. Settle Arguments with Data, Not Force

> "Any argument that can't be settled in five minutes can't be settled by arguing." - Kent Beck

- Technical disagreements without data won't forge agreement
- Force of character (yelling, condescension) doesn't settle anything long-term
- If you agree, you MUST engage - passive-aggressive sabotage is the worst unprofessional behavior
- Run experiments, simulations, or flip a coin and set criteria for abandonment

**For team disagreements**:
- Each arguer presents case in 5 minutes or less
- Team votes
- Whole meeting under 15 minutes

### 8. Execute True Priorities Despite Discomfort

Professionals evaluate priority disregarding personal fears and desires.

- Don't elevate comfortable tasks over scary-but-important ones
- Recognize when you're building defenses against others' judgment
- Priority inversion is a lie to yourself and others

### 9. Recognize Blind Alleys and Back Out

Keep options open by keeping an open mind about alternatives.

- Never become so vested you can't abandon an idea
- When in a hole, stop digging
- Backing out is not failure - it's prudence

### 10. Fear Messes More Than Blind Alleys

The inflection point is when going back will never be easier than now.

- Always watch for messes growing without bound
- Expend all necessary effort to escape early
- Moving forward through a known swamp is the worst priority inversion
- Clean messes as soon as they are recognized

## Guidelines

- Use your manager to defend your meeting decline decisions
- Block early morning hours for focused work before chaos begins
- Schedule reactive time for afternoons when interruptions are highest
- Use 15-minute scheduling increments with gaps for interruption handling
- Protect your sleep - it's your primary focus-manna source
- Take 30-60 minutes to de-focus when manna is depleted - forcing focus produces bad code

## Exceptions

- **Authority requests**: When someone senior requests attendance, weigh authority against work schedule with your team/manager
- **Team helping team**: Sometimes worth the loss to your project to help another team - discuss with your team first
