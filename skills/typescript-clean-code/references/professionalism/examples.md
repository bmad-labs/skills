# Professionalism Examples

Scenarios demonstrating professional vs unprofessional behavior.

## Unprofessional Behavior Scenarios

### Shipping Without Testing

**Scenario**: Developer ships software on the promised date without testing a critical feature because "the bug fixes weren't in that code."

**What happened**:
- Software caused customer data loss
- Multiple customers affected simultaneously
- Took days to diagnose and fix
- Field service manager fielded angry calls
- Customer trust damaged

**Why it's unprofessional**:
- Prioritized "saving face" over customer needs
- Rationalized skipping tests to meet deadline
- Passed consequences to others (customers, field service)

**Professional alternative**:
- Communicate that testing isn't complete
- Delay ship date if necessary
- Take responsibility early, before damage occurs

### Using QA as Bug Catchers

**Scenario**: Developer sends code to QA knowing it hasn't been thoroughly checked, relying on QA to find and report bugs.

**Why it's unprofessional**:
- Shifts responsibility to QA team
- Damages schedules when bugs are found late
- Undermines confidence in development team
- Lazy and irresponsible behavior
- Violates "do no harm" principle

**Professional alternative**:
- Test thoroughly before release
- Expect QA to find nothing
- Be surprised and investigate when bugs escape

### Letting Employer Own Your Career

**Scenario**: Developer does only assigned work during work hours, expects employer to provide all training, and doesn't learn new technologies.

**Why it's unprofessional**:
- Career becomes dependent on employer's priorities
- Skills stagnate and become outdated
- Industry passes them by
- Others with current skills advance instead

**Professional alternative**:
- Invest 20 hours/week in personal development
- Read books, attend conferences, learn new languages
- Take ownership of career trajectory

### Coding Without Domain Knowledge

**Scenario**: Developer implements accounting system features exactly as specified, without understanding why the spec makes business sense.

**Why it's unprofessional**:
- Can't recognize or challenge specification errors
- Builds features that may not solve real problems
- Misses opportunities to suggest better solutions
- Abdication of professional judgment

**Professional alternative**:
- Read books on accounting
- Interview users about fundamentals
- Understand principles behind specifications
- Challenge specs that don't make sense

---

### Refusing to Touch Working Code

**Scenario**: Developer avoids making structural improvements because "if it ain't broke, don't fix it."

**Why it's unprofessional**:
- Code becomes rigid over time
- Future changes become exorbitantly expensive
- Technical debt accumulates
- Eventually the project becomes mired in "tar pit"

**Professional alternative**:
- Make small improvements with every touch
- Follow Boy Scout Rule
- Use tests to enable fearless refactoring
- Treat code like clay to be continuously shaped

## Professional Behavior Scenarios

### Taking Responsibility Early

**Scenario**: Developer realizes tests aren't complete but deadline is tomorrow. They inform the manager immediately.

**Actions**:
- Communicate honestly about status
- Explain the risk of shipping untested code
- Propose alternatives (delay, partial release)
- Accept the difficult conversation

**Why it's professional**:
- Protects customers from potential harm
- Demonstrates accountability
- Allows informed decision-making
- Builds long-term trust

### Continuous Learning in Practice

**Scenario**: Developer structures their week to include professional development.

**Actions**:
- Uses lunch hour to read technical books
- Listens to podcasts during commute
- Spends 90 minutes daily learning a new language
- Does morning kata to warm up
- Attends monthly user group meetings

**Why it's professional**:
- Takes ownership of career
- Maintains current skills
- Builds expertise beyond current job
- Prevents burnout through passion reinforcement

---

### Fearless Refactoring

**Scenario**: Developer reads through a module and notices a method that's getting long.

**Actions**:
- Runs existing test suite (passes)
- Repartitions the method into smaller pieces
- Runs tests again (passes)
- Commits the improvement
- Continues with original task

**Why it's professional**:
- Maintains code structure continuously
- Tests enable confident changes
- Small improvements compound over time
- Treats code as malleable material

---

### Mentoring a Junior Developer

**Scenario**: New developer joins the team, unfamiliar with the codebase.

**Actions**:
- Sits down with them personally
- Walks through system architecture
- Explains team conventions and practices
- Pairs on initial tasks
- Remains available for questions

**Why it's professional**:
- Doesn't let junior "flail about unsupervised"
- Teaching deepens own understanding
- Accelerates team productivity
- Fulfills responsibility to profession

### Humble Response to Failure

**Scenario**: Developer's estimate turns out wrong. The team jokes about it.

**Actions**:
- Laughs at themselves first
- Acknowledges the mistake openly
- Adjusts approach for future estimates

**Why it's professional**:
- Accepts failure is inevitable
- Uses failure as learning opportunity

## Contrasts Summary

| Situation | Unprofessional | Professional |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| Deadline pressure | Skip tests to ship on time | Communicate risk, negotiate scope |
| QA process | Send code hoping QA catches bugs | Expect QA to find nothing |
| Career development | Wait for employer to provide training | Invest 20 hours/week personally |
| Domain knowledge | Code blindly from spec | Learn domain, challenge errors |
| Working code | Don't touch it | Improve it continuously |
| New team member | Let them figure it out | Mentor them personally |
| Personal failure | Deflect blame | Laugh, learn, improve |
