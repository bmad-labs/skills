  Clean Code principles, professional practices, and workflows for TypeScript developers. Based on Robert C. Martin's "Clean Code" and "The Clean Coder" books.
  
  Use this skill when:
  - Writing new TypeScript/JavaScript functions, classes, or modules
  - Reviewing code or pull requests
  - Refactoring existing code
  - Following test-driven development (TDD)
  - Fixing bugs with proper test coverage
  - Planning test strategy for features
  - Estimating tasks accurately
  - Handling deadlines and commitments professionally
  - Working effectively with teams

# Clean Code

Principles, practices, and workflows for TypeScript developers.

## Quick Start

1. **For a task**: Check `guidelines.md` → find the right workflow
2. **For reference**: Load only the files relevant to your work
3. **Follow the workflow**: Step-by-step process for consistent results

## Workflows

Step-by-step processes for common tasks:

| Workflow | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| `workflows/code-review.md` | Reviewing code for quality |
| `workflows/pr-review.md` | Reviewing pull requests |
| `workflows/tdd.md` | Test-driven development cycle |
| `workflows/refactoring.md` | Safe refactoring with tests |
| `workflows/new-feature.md` | Building new functionality |
| `workflows/bug-fix.md` | Fixing bugs properly |
| `workflows/test-strategy.md` | Planning test coverage |
| `workflows/estimation.md` | Estimating tasks (PERT) |
| `workflows/deadline-negotiation.md` | Handling unrealistic deadlines |

## Key Principles

### Code Quality
1. **Readability** - Code is read far more than written
2. **Single Responsibility** - Each unit does one thing well
3. **Small Units** - Functions ~5-20 lines, focused classes
4. **Meaningful Names** - Names reveal intent
5. **DRY** - Don't Repeat Yourself
6. **Clean Tests** - Tests are first-class citizens

### Professional Practices
1. **Take Responsibility** - Own your code and decisions
2. **Say No** - Decline impossible commitments professionally
3. **Commit Clearly** - Use "I will... by..." language
4. **Estimates != Commitments** - Communicate uncertainty
5. **Stay Clean Under Pressure** - Don't abandon practices in crisis

## Guidelines

See `guidelines.md` for:
- Task → workflow mapping
- Situation → reference file mapping
- Decision tree for common scenarios
