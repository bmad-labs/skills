# Time Management Knowledge

Core concepts and foundational understanding for developer time management.

## Overview

Professionals have only 480 minutes (8 hours) per day and must use them efficiently. Time management for developers involves protecting focused work time, minimizing meeting overhead, and maintaining the mental energy needed for programming.

## Key Concepts

### Focus-Manna

**Definition**: A finite mental resource required for concentration and programming that depletes with use and must be recharged.

Programming requires extended periods of concentration. Focus-manna is expended during intellectual work and cannot be forced once depleted.

**Key points**:
- You can *feel* when focus-manna is present or depleted
- It decays if not used - wasting it in meetings means none left for coding
- Worry and distractions consume focus-manna rapidly
- Code written without focus-manna will likely need rewriting

### Meeting Cost

**Definition**: The true expense of meetings calculated as ~$200/hour per attendee (including salary, benefits, facilities).

Meetings have two truths: they are necessary AND they are huge time wasters. Often both apply to the same meeting - some attendees find value, others find it redundant.

**Key points**:
- Calculate the actual cost of meetings you attend
- Your presence costs your employer real money
- Remaining in wasteful meetings is unprofessional

### Priority Inversion

**Definition**: Raising the priority of a less important task to avoid a task you find scary, uncomfortable, or boring.

This is a lie we tell ourselves - we know the avoided task is truly more important but we build defenses against the judgment of others.

**Key points**:
- Often triggered by fear of confrontation or inescapable problems
- Professionals execute tasks in true priority order regardless of personal discomfort

### Blind Alleys

**Definition**: Technical pathways that lead nowhere, often discovered only after significant investment.

The more vested you are in a decision, the longer you'll wander. Staking professional reputation leads to endless wandering.

**Key points**:
- Unavoidable - even experience won't prevent all blind alleys
- Key skill is recognizing them quickly and having courage to back out
- "The Rule of Holes": When you are in one, stop digging

### Messes (Bogs/Swamps)

**Definition**: Technical debt that slows progress but doesn't stop it - you can always see a way forward that looks shorter than going back (but isn't).

Messes are worse than blind alleys because you can still make progress through brute force, deceiving yourself about the true cost.

**Key points**:
- Nothing has more negative effect on team productivity than a mess
- The progression is insidious - starts clean, then design choices don't scale
- The inflection point is when going back will never be easier than now
- Moving forward through a known swamp is the worst priority inversion

## Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Focus-manna | Finite mental energy for concentration |
| Pomodoro/Tomato | 25-minute focused work session |
| Priority inversion | Avoiding important work by elevating lesser tasks |
| Blind alley | Technical dead-end requiring backtracking |
| Mess/Bog/Swamp | Technical debt that impedes but doesn't stop progress |

## Recharging Strategies

### Sleep
Seven hours of sleep provides a full eight hours of focus-manna. Professionals manage sleep schedules to arrive at work with topped-up focus.

### Physical Activity (Muscle Focus)
Physical disciplines (martial arts, yoga, cycling, carpentry) use a different kind of focus that helps recharge mental focus. Regular muscle focus *increases* capacity for mental focus.

### De-focusing Activities
- Long walks
- Conversations with friends
- Looking out a window
- Meditation or power naps
- Podcasts or light reading

### Input for Output
Creative work requires creative input. Reading fiction or exposure to others' creativity stimulates your own creative capacity.

## Quick Reference

| Concept | One-Line Summary |
|---------|-----------------|
| Focus-manna | Finite mental resource - protect and recharge it |
| Meeting cost | ~$200/hour/person - calculate before attending |
| Priority inversion | Lying to avoid scary work - fight it as honor |
| Blind alleys | Recognize quickly, back out with courage |
| Messes | Fear them more than blind alleys - escape early |
| Sleep | 7 hours sleep = 8 hours focus capacity |
| Muscle focus | Physical activity recharges mental focus |
