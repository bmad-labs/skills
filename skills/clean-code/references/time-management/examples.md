# Time Management Examples

Scenarios demonstrating good vs bad time management decisions.

## Bad Examples

### Accepting All Meeting Invites

**Scenario**: Developer receives invite for cross-team architecture discussion. Topic is interesting but unrelated to current sprint work.

**Bad Decision**: Accepts because "it might be useful to know about" and "I don't want to seem unhelpful."

**Problems**:
- 2-hour meeting costs focus-manna needed for actual deliverables
- Sets precedent for future invites
- No immediate benefit to current responsibilities
- Interest is not the same as necessity

---

### Staying in Hijacked Meetings

**Scenario**: Joined a 30-minute meeting about API design. After 15 minutes, discussion shifts to someone's pet peeve about logging standards.

**Bad Decision**: Stays for remaining 45 minutes (meeting runs over) because "it would be rude to leave."

**Problems**:
- Remaining is unprofessional - you're wasting employer's money
- You had no value to add to the new topic
- Lost an hour that could have been productive

---

### Avoiding the Hard Task

**Scenario**: Need to refactor authentication module (scary, might break things). Instead, spend morning on "urgent" task of reorganizing test folder structure.

**Bad Decision**: Convince yourself folder organization is more important right now.

**Problems**:
- Classic priority inversion
- Building defenses against future judgment ("I was being productive!")
- Auth refactor remains undone and gets harder over time
- The lie compounds - tomorrow you'll find another avoidance task

---

### Pushing Through a Blind Alley

**Scenario**: Chose microservices architecture. Two months in, realize the overhead is killing velocity for a team of three. But you championed this approach.

**Bad Decision**: Double down. "We just need better tooling. Once we get past this hump..."

**Problems**:
- Professional reputation became more important than project success
- Each day forward makes the return path longer
- Team suffers while you protect ego

---

### Wading Through the Swamp

**Scenario**: Original design doesn't scale with new requirements. Refactoring back looks like 2 weeks. Pushing forward looks like 1 week.

**Bad Decision**: Push forward. "We're so close, we can clean it up later."

**Problems**:
- Forward path is always deceptively shorter
- "Later" never comes - next feature adds more mess
- Team productivity enters death spiral
- Moving forward through known swamp is worst priority inversion

---

### Coding Without Focus

**Scenario**: 3 PM, focus-manna depleted after morning meetings. Critical feature deadline tomorrow.

**Bad Decision**: Power through with coffee. "I'll just push harder."

**Problems**:
- Code written without focus requires rewriting
- Creates mess that slows future work
- Jittery caffeine focus goes in wrong directions
- Better to take 30-60 min break, return refreshed

## Good Examples

### Declining with Professionalism

**Scenario**: Same cross-team architecture invite as above.

**Good Decision**: "Thanks for including me. My sprint commitments won't allow me to attend, but I'd appreciate the meeting notes. Let me know if there's a specific topic where my input is essential."

**Why it works**:
- Protects your time for actual responsibilities
- Leaves door open for truly necessary inclusion
- Manager will support this decision

---

### Negotiating Meeting Exit

**Scenario**: Same hijacked API meeting.

**Good Decision**: At natural pause: "I need to get back to my sprint work. Is there anything else about the API design where you need my input before I go?"

**Why it works**:
- Polite but clear
- Offers final chance for relevant contribution
- Models professional time management for others

---

### Facing the Hard Task

**Scenario**: Same scary auth refactor.

**Good Decision**: Block first two hours of day (highest focus-manna) for auth work. Write down fears specifically. Start with smallest piece.

**Why it works**:
- Uses best focus time for hardest work
- Naming fears reduces their power
- Small start builds momentum
- Priority order maintained despite discomfort

---

### Backing Out of Blind Alley

**Scenario**: Same microservices realization.

**Good Decision**: Call team meeting. "I advocated for microservices, but the data shows it's not working for our team size. I recommend we consolidate. Here's a migration plan."

**Why it works**:
- Ego subordinated to project success
- Demonstrates professional courage
- Team respects honesty over stubbornness
- Earlier exit = less rework

---

### Escaping the Swamp Early

**Scenario**: Same scaling problem.

**Good Decision**: "The 2-week refactor is actually cheaper than the 1-week push. Going forward will never be easier than now. Let's fix the design."

**Why it works**:
- Recognizes the deception of "shorter path forward"
- Understands inflection point
- Prevents productivity death spiral
- Shows fear of messes (appropriate professional fear)

## Pomodoro Technique in Practice

### Setup
```
25 minutes: Focused work (tomato time)
5 minutes: Short break
Repeat 4x
30 minutes: Long break
```

### Handling Interruptions

**During tomato**: "I'm in the middle of something - can I get back to you in 15 minutes?"

**What it achieves**:
- Most interruptions can wait 25 minutes
- Creates predictable availability windows
- 12-14 tomatoes = excellent day
- 2-3 tomatoes = day consumed by "stuff"
- Tracking reveals time usage patterns

## Time Blocking Example

From the book - managing a 15-person department:

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 5:00 AM | Wake, bike to office |
| 6:00-9:00 | Quiet focused work (fully scheduled) |
| 9:00-12:00 | Scheduled work with 15-min gaps/hour for interruptions |
| 12:00+ | Unscheduled - reactive mode for chaos |

**Why it works**:
- Protects 3 hours before interruptions begin
- Built-in slots for pushing interruptions into
- Acknowledges reality of afternoon chaos
- When chaos doesn't intrude, works on most important thing
