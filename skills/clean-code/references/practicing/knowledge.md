# Practicing Knowledge

Core concepts and foundational understanding for deliberate practice in software development.

## Overview

Professional programmers practice their craft just like musicians, athletes, and doctors. Practice involves skill-sharpening exercises done on your own time to build muscle memory and quick decision-making. The goal is to make common solutions automatic so your mind can focus on higher-level problems.

## Key Concepts

### The Coding Dojo

**Definition**: A practice space where programmers gather (or practice solo) to sharpen their skills through structured exercises.

The martial arts metaphor fits programming practice well - both require quick reactions, pattern recognition, and automatic responses built through repetition.

**Key points**:
- Practice sessions can be solo or group-based
- Focus is on perfecting movements/keystrokes, not just solving problems
- Goal is to make solutions instinctive and automatic

### Kata

**Definition**: A precise set of choreographed keystrokes and movements that simulates solving a programming problem you already know the solution to.

You aren't solving the problem - you're practicing the movements and decisions involved. The asymptote of perfection is the goal: repeat until movements are automatic.

**Key points**:
- Learn hot keys and navigation idioms
- Practice disciplines like TDD and CI
- Drive problem/solution pairs into your subconscious
- Know several kata and practice regularly so they don't fade

### Wasa (Ping-Pong)

**Definition**: A two-person practice technique where partners alternate roles while working through a problem.

One programmer writes a unit test, the other makes it pass, then they swap roles. Can use a known kata (practicing form) or a new problem (competitive challenge).

**Key points**:
- Critique each other's techniques
- Test writer controls problem direction
- Can add constraints to challenge partner

### Randori

**Definition**: Free-form group practice where multiple people take turns writing tests and making them pass.

Screen projected on wall, one person writes a test and sits down, next person makes it pass and writes another test. Rotates through the group.

**Key points**:
- Learn how others solve problems
- Broaden your own approach
- Can be sequential or voluntary participation

## Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Kata | Choreographed solo exercise for a known problem |
| Wasa | Two-person paired practice (ping-pong) |
| Randori | Free-form group practice with rotating participants |
| Dojo | Practice space/session for skill development |
| TDD | Test-Driven Development - red/green/refactor loop |

## How It Relates To

- **TDD**: Practice builds speed for the red-green-refactor loop
- **Professionalism**: Practice is part of being a professional
- **Time Management**: Practice happens on your own time, not employer's

## Common Misconceptions

- **Myth**: Practice means working on real projects more
  **Reality**: Practice is separate from production work - it's deliberate repetition of known problems

- **Myth**: Experienced developers don't need practice
  **Reality**: All professionals practice to maintain and sharpen skills

- **Myth**: Fast coding is just about typing speed
  **Reality**: Speed comes from pattern recognition and automatic responses built through practice

## Quick Reference

| Concept | One-Line Summary |
|---------|-----------------|
| Kata | Solo choreographed exercises for known problems |
| Wasa | Paired ping-pong practice |
| Randori | Group rotation practice |
| Dojo | Practice session or space |
| Purpose | Build muscle memory for automatic problem-solving |
