# Pressure Examples

Scenarios demonstrating professional and unprofessional behavior under pressure.

## Unprofessional Behavior Scenarios

### The Surgeon Analogy

Imagine you're on an operating table watching a surgeon perform open heart surgery on you under a deadline - a *literal* deadline.

**Unprofessional behavior**:
- Sweating and swearing
- Slamming and throwing instruments
- Blaming management for unrealistic expectations
- Continuously complaining about time
- Behaving "like a typical developer"

**Why it fails**: This behavior doesn't help meet the deadline and creates chaos that makes outcomes worse.

### The Start-up Death Spiral

**Scenario**: Company burning through financing, product vision constantly changing, pressure to deliver for demos and customers.

**Unprofessional responses observed**:
- Working 80-hour weeks as "heroism"
- Writing 3,000-line functions at 2 AM
- Arguments with shouting and name calling
- Throwing pens, punching walls
- "Hacking some mess together" for customer demos
- Getting people fired who didn't "shape up"

**Results**:
- Functions that were unmaintainable (3,000 lines of C)
- Constant anger and stress
- Personal life destruction
- Never-ending cycle of crises

**The turning point**: Realizing this approach was "making life miserable for himself and others in the name of---what?"

### Discipline Abandonment

**Scenario**: Developer follows TDD in normal times but abandons it when deadline pressure hits.

**What this reveals**: They don't actually trust that TDD is helpful. If they believed it worked, they'd use it especially when it matters most.

**Similar patterns**:
- Keeping code clean normally, making messes under pressure → Don't believe messes slow you down
- Not pairing normally, but pairing in crisis → Believe pairing is actually more efficient

## Professional Behavior Scenarios

### The Calm Surgeon

**Scenario**: Surgeon under time pressure performing critical operation.

**Professional behavior**:
- Appearing calm and collected
- Issuing clear and precise orders to support staff
- Following training and adhering to disciplines
- No panic, no blaming, no complaining

**Why it works**: The trained disciplines exist precisely for these moments.

### Commitment Management

**Scenario**: Business makes promises to customers without consulting developers.

**Professional response**:
- Help the business find a way to meet commitments
- Do not accept responsibility for commitments you didn't make
- Quantify and present risk so business can manage it
- If no way is found, those who made promises accept responsibility

**Key distinction**: Professionals help the business achieve goals but don't accept commitments made for them.

### Pressure Response Protocol

**Scenario**: Project taking longer than expected, initial design is wrong and needs rework, commitment can't be kept.

**Professional response sequence**:

1. **Don't Panic**
   - Resist the urge to rush
   - Slow down and think the problem through
   - Plot course to best possible outcome
   - Drive toward it at reasonable, steady pace

2. **Communicate**
   - Tell team and superiors you're in trouble
   - Share your best plans for getting out
   - Ask for their input and guidance
   - Avoid creating surprises

3. **Rely on Disciplines**
   - Write even more tests than usual
   - Refactor even more carefully
   - Keep functions even smaller
   - Become more deliberate and dedicated

4. **Get Help**
   - Find someone to pair program with
   - Let them help you hold onto disciplines
   - Let them spot things you miss
   - Offer the same help to others under pressure

## Contrasting Approaches

| Situation | Unprofessional | Professional |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| Tight deadline | Rush and cut corners | Slow down, stay disciplined |
| Unrealistic commitment | Accept and stress | Quantify risk, present options |
| Code quality vs speed | Create messes | Stay clean (dirty = slow) |
| Crisis hits | Abandon practices | Trust disciplines more |
| Getting behind | Work alone, longer hours | Communicate, pair up |
| Others make promises | Accept blame | Help but don't accept commitments |

## Key Insight

> "You know what you believe by observing yourself in a crisis. If in a crisis you follow your disciplines, then you truly believe in those disciplines."

The way to handle pressure:
- **Avoid it** by managing commitments, following disciplines, keeping clean
- **Weather it** by staying calm, communicating, following disciplines, getting help
