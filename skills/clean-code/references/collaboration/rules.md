# Collaboration Rules

Rules for professional collaboration between developers and with business stakeholders.

## Core Rules

### 1. Practice Collective Code Ownership

Break down all walls of code ownership and have the team own all the code.

- Any team member can check out any module
- Any team member can make changes they think are appropriate
- The *team* owns the code, not individuals
- Do not prevent others from working in the code

### 2. Do Not Build Walls Around Code

Professional developers do not build walls of ownership around code.

- Don't refuse to let others touch "your" code
- Don't hide your code from other programmers
- Don't tie your identity or status to particular modules
- Work with each other on as much of the system as possible

### 3. Pair with Other Programmers

Professionals pair because it is often the most efficient way to solve problems.

- Pair to share knowledge with each other
- Pair to review code collaboratively (most effective review method)
- Pair to ensure no knowledge silos exist
- All team members should be able to play another position in a pinch

### 4. Work Together Physically

Face each other, communicate constantly, work as a unit.

- Sit around tables facing each other, not in corners
- Don't isolate with headphones all day
- Enable serendipitous communication (verbal and body language)
- Overhear frustrated mutterings, sense the team's state

### 5. Review All Code

No system should consist of code that hasn't been reviewed by other programmers.

- Pairing is the most efficient code review method
- Collaboration in writing code is better than after-the-fact review
- Every piece of code needs another set of eyes

## Guidelines

Less strict recommendations:

- Learn different parts of the system by pairing with others
- Learn the business domain by working with teammates who know it
- Recognize that all team members have a primary position but should be versatile
- Accept that programming is fundamentally about working with people

## Exceptions

When these rules may be relaxed:

- **Deep thinking time**: Sometimes you need to think long and hard about a problem alone
- **Trivial tasks**: When the task is so simple that another person would be wasted
- **Personal focus time**: Short periods of solo work are acceptable within a collaborative culture

However, "in general, it is best to collaborate closely with others and to pair with them a large fraction of the time."

## Quick Reference

| Rule | Summary |
|------|---------|
| Collective Ownership | Team owns all code; anyone can modify anything |
| No Walls | Don't hide or protect "your" code from teammates |
| Pair Regularly | Best way to share knowledge and review code |
| Face Each Other | Physical proximity enables team communication |
| Review Everything | All code needs review; pairing is most efficient |
