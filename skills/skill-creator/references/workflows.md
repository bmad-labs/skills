# Workflow Patterns

## Sequential Workflows

For complex tasks, break operations into clear, sequential steps. It is often helpful to give Claude an overview of the process towards the beginning of SKILL.md:

```markdown
Filling a PDF form involves these steps:

1. Analyze the form (run analyze_form.py)
2. Create field mapping (edit fields.json)
3. Validate mapping (run validate_fields.py)
4. Fill the form (run fill_form.py)
5. Verify output (run verify_output.py)
```

## Conditional Workflows

For tasks with branching logic, guide Claude through decision points:

```markdown
1. Determine the modification type:
   **Creating new content?** → Follow "Creation workflow" below
   **Editing existing content?** → Follow "Editing workflow" below

2. Creation workflow: [steps]
3. Editing workflow: [steps]
```

## Step-File Workflows (Context-Safe)

For long workflows (5+ steps or 150+ lines) that risk losing progress during context compaction, use the **step-file architecture**: one file per step with YAML frontmatter progress tracking and automatic continuation detection.

See `references/step-file-workflows.md` for the complete pattern, including directory structure, templates, continuation detection, loop handling, and design guidelines.
